# 1. In the clustering tutorial, we used k-means clustering to identify 
# 3 clusters of colleges using these criteria.

# 1.1. Replicate this analysis using the code in the tutorial to generate those 
# 3 clusters and append the cluster levels to the college_features dataset. 
# If you are getting an error using mutate, use the following code instead: 
# college_features$cluster = kmeans_cluster$cluster

# select relevant features
college_features = colleges %>% 
  select(institution_name, first_gen_share, poverty_rate, family_income_median, median_earnings, top_ten) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% distinct()

# run k-means clustering
kmeans_cluster = kmeans(select(college_features, -institution_name, -top_ten), 3)

# Find which cluster the observations belong to
#head(kmeans_cluster$cluster)

# append the cluster assignment onto the dataset

# (hint: see kmeans_cluster$centers from the tutorial)?

# 1.3. Subset the colleges_features dataset on the cluster with the lowest 
# family_income_median, call this new data grant_candidates.

# you could find that a different cluster from your analysis

# 5 clusters instead of 3.

# 2.1. Redo the k-means analysis above but create 5 clusters instead of 3.

# Based on those other variables, do you think we made the correct decision

# 3. Hierarchical clustering: Part of the grant is to reformulate curriculums
# to better match top ten universities.

# 3.1. Subset your colleges dataset using the following code.

# so we are looking at similar degree-granting universities. 
# What other criteria are we using to subset?
